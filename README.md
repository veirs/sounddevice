README file

This docker file is used by balena-cloud to build an image that installs libraries needed to run 
    sounddevices in python3 ( https://python-sounddevice )

Libraries and programs include ALSA, python3, pip3, numpy, portaudio, sounddevice, SoundFile

It seems that these allow an image to be built that will run on a RaspberryPi 3B
